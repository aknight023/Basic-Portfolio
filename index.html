			<p>My name is Anthony Knight and I am from Portsmouth, NH. I graduated from Penn State University with a Bachelor of Sciences in Information Sciences and Technology and a Minor in Security Risk Analysis.  I currently work at Liberty Mutual Insurance as an Information Security Analyst. I am currently exploring a new career path of trying to broaden my skills in coding, problem solving, and being more hands on. The way the tech industry is going I fell like coding should be learn as a second language. As Tim cook, CEO of Apple, says “it’s better to learn to code than learn English as a second language.” I would 100% have to agree with him on that. Coding is the language of the future. </p>
